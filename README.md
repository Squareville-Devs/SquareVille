## Diclaimer 
This project is officially not open-source anymore and it now belongs to [KinesisGames](https://www.kinesis.games).

## Game Description
Squareville will feature a world to explore and as focus will be more on gameplay rather than graphics, objects in the game will consistently be  made up of primitive shapes (cubes, spheres, cylinders). As the game advances, stuff like cars, weapons, crafting and more customization will be added. As far as customization goes, this includes for example coloring objects in the game, designing faces for the character and adding paints/skins to the vehicles or weapons.

## How to contribute
### Forking/Cloning
This repository has 2 branches; ``master`` and ``testing``. Fork the repository from the ``master`` branch to your GitHub account, clone your forked repository and start by looking at what has already been done! Try getting a grasp on how everything currently works.
### Choose a task
See the ``TASKS.md`` file. It contains brief details on what needs to be done for Squareville. If you wish to work on an existing task, please submit a Pull Request to add your GutHub username and to be assigned the task you wish to work on. If you wish to work on something which is not present in ``TASKS.md``, again, submit a Pull Request to add an entry for that task with your GitHub username. Please note that each task may be worked on by one user only unless specifically told not to. You may start to work on a task only when your pull request to add your username (or custom task) has been accepted.
### Working on a task 
Please make sure to **not** modify any scripts or existing file(s) when making a contribution. If you'll be needing to create additional assets, do so but do not overwrite any existing assets. For example, when making a new feature, create a new script. All scripts need to have some comments to explain the purpose of the code. These do not need to describe each line specifically. Comments are mandatory but should be kept brief. To test new features, make new scenes. As this is a rather complex discussion and some tasks may specifically require assets to be overwritten, please contact us via our Discord server.
### Submitting a contribution
Always make sure that you have the latest changes from the ``master`` branch with ``git pull``. Then do a ``git add *`` from the root directory, followed by a ``git commit -am "<message>"`` to describe your changes and finally a ``git push``. Create a Pull Request from **your** ``master`` branch to the ``testing`` branch of **this** repository. The maintainers will see if everything seems correct and if so, the changes will be merged to the ``testing`` branch. If not, the maintainers will ask for more work. Changes made will be tested and after everything has been proved to work correctly, changes will be pushed to the ``master`` branch.

## Additional Details
Unity version: 2019.3.x is recommended.
